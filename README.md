  Welcome to the SQL Study Cases repository! This project contains a collection of SQL study cases that I have worked on to enhance my data analysis skills using SQL. Each study case presents a unique scenario with specific datasets and objectives, aimed at solving real-world data problems through SQL querying.

  The primary goals of this project are:

  - To demonstrate the application of various SQL techniques and functions for data analysis.
  - To provide clear and well-documented solutions for educational purposes.
  - To showcase different approaches to data manipulation, aggregation, and reporting using SQL.
  - To serve as a reference for others looking to improve their data analysis skills with SQL through practical, hands-on examples.

  These study cases cover a wide range of topics, including data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and complex querying, making them ideal for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of SQL in the context of data analysis.
